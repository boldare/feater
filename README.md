# Introduction

**Feater** is a tool for rapid deployment of selected features of your web
application to isolated testing or demo environments.

**It’s open-source.**
It's released under MIT license. You can use it for free as well as modify it to
suit your needs.

**It’s tech-agnostic.**
It can be used regardless of languages or dependencies used in your project.
This is possible because it uses Docker containers and Docker Compose
configurations.

**It’s easy to use.**
If your project has a Docker Compose setup and some build scripts you won't need
much more to run it with Feater.

**It’s easy to host.**
It runs in Docker containers and you can use it on your local machine or set up
a dedicated server for it.
