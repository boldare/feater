# Assets

Assets should be used to provide some data that can either be copied
into specific service/container or used to create a prepopulated Docker
volume. Each asset is given an ID that will be used to reference it in
volumes section of definition.

**TODO Add image**

Assets that are to be used to prepopulate volumes should be .tar.gz
archives.
