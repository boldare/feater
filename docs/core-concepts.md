# Core concepts

There are few core concepts in Feater, starting from the bottom of their
hierarchy:

- **instance** - a set of Docker containers include in referenced Docker
  Compose setup built from source code checked out from referenced
  commits/tags/branches from specific repositories;

- **definition** - contains a recipe for preparing instances, clarifying
  sources that should be checked out, volumes that should be
  prepopulated, commands that should be run before and after running
  Docker Compose setup, ports to be proxied to externaly available
  domains;

- **asset** - a file that can be used as a source of data for
  prepopulating volumes on copied into specified Docker containers;

- **deploy key** - SSH key generated by Feater that should be added as
  deploy key to a specific private repository that needs to be cloned
  when preparing an instance;

- **project** - used to group definitions and assets.

We will discuss these in more details in following sections, starting
from the top this time.
